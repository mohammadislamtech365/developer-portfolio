                    A web developer makes and maintains websites. They are in charge of a siteâ€™s overall look and feel. Web developers also handle the technical aspects of a website, including its performance (website speed) and capacity (the maximum amount of traffic the site could handle at a given time). A web developer is usually knowledgeable in both graphic design and programming.
                    Web developers deal with different kinds of websites, including e-commerce, gaming, and news sites.
